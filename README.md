Yardsale constantly analyzes search words and information on items that users have seen in detail. By processing the images of the products, we realize the accuracy that has never existed.
For example, if some users are looking at red shirts or red shoes, Yardsale suggest a red tie. Also Yardsale will change the items Yardsale recommend according to users' residence. Do high school students living in Texas need a thick coat? The answer is no.
From ordinary purchase activities, we will organize these information and make it easy to find the products you always need.
