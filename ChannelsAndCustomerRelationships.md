# Connecting to Customer Segments

We plan on connecting to customer segments through notifications on our app, which alll of our coustomers will already have. We would raise 
customer awareness by biving them notifications whem we seem similar things to what the have recently bought, posted on the app. Because our
buisness plan is based on us getting a portion of every sale, customers do not actually evaluate whether we have a good product to buy, but whether
other users who have posted a item have a good product. By doing this, we deliver value by putting a buyer and a seller in contact with each
other so that they can make a transaction. Yardsale has a dedicated support team to help users on both technical and other issues that they can contact 
though our app. 

# Maintaing Customer Relationships

Social media seems like the most practical way to stay in our customers lives outside of using our business. Having an active Twitter that posts daily could be a way great way to stay in touch with customers as well as a way to bring in new ones. Facebook could also be a great way for us to connect to our customers also while connecting our customers to eachother. A relationship with our customers most likely looks like one of communicating anoucements and changes to our userbase through widespread media. Since we are a user to user site dealing with transactions, there are many elements of customer support that need to be implemented. Customers need to have a dedicated site section to answer their questions as well as address their disputes in transactions. This would most likely take the form of a forum. For our type of site, an automated system likely isn't the goto method as money is in play. Users most likely don't expect strong relationships between themselves and the company but having a high quality customer support service at the ready will keep our users happy. By using modern means of communicating with our customers and showing them we are always there to help we could see our currrent customer segements grow as well as new ones join. The recommendation and repuatution we acquire will go a long way.
